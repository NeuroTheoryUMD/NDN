Welcome to Neural Deep Network's documentation!
===============================================

The Neural Deep Network (NDN) is a modeling framework for describing nonlinear 
computations in experimentally-measured neural data. This framework can be used 
to create feed-forward stimulus processing models as well as latent variable 
models. The code is written using the tensorflow_ library in python, and is
developed and maintained by the `Neurotheory Lab`_ at the University of Maryland
under the direction of Dan Butts.
